Collatz conjecture is a famous unsolved problem in mathematics:

The rules are simple,

f(n) = n/2 if n is even, n*3+1 if n is odd

We "win" when we reach 1.

Example: we start with 5 then 16 then 8 then 4 then 2 then 1 - total 5 steps

Example: we start with 1 - 0 steps

Implement a program that asks for user input then uses a recursive algorithm to output next number on screen and also keep track of steps.

You can write a regular non-recursive function to test if you want, but you must write a recursive one.

Is there any way to speed up these recursive calculations?

Test your program on the following numbers: 57, 289, 871

Submit answers (steps taken) for the above 3 numbers for example 62 46 163

Submit code as usual.
