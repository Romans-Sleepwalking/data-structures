Write a program that prompts the user to enter a personâ€™s date of birth

in numeric form such as 18-11-2004. The program then outputs the

date of birth in the form: October, 18th, 2004.

Your program must contain at least two exception classes: invalidDay and invalidMonth, but preferably also invalidYear as well.

If the user enters an invalid value for day, then the program should

throw and catch an invalidDay object. Follow similar conventions for

the invalid values of month and year.

(Note that your program must

handle a leap year from at least 1900 to 2050).

You are allowed to use existing libraries provided by standard C++, but still must make your own exception classes).

IMPORTANT! If you adopt parts of an existing solution, then provide source in the comments! Failure to provide comments for existing code fragments will result in 0.
