Maximum product in array



Read the supplied text file  numbers_-50_50_20.txt

Convert numbers to array structure. (you are encouraged to use vector or could you another sequence type).

Find the maximum product of TWO array elements.

Example:

if your numbers in array are 5,4,-10,-7, 3,-8,9 -> the answer will be 80, because -10 *  -8 is 80

Think about how to reduce complexity of your algorithm. Brute force solutions will not get full marks :P

1. Submit your source code main.cpp as file with your name and student id comments up top

//FirstName_LastName_220ADB5325



Comment your code! Uncommented code will get less or no score!



2. Submit the solution - single number as text (for example 84161)



//Your solution should work even if there are duplicate numbers in the file.
