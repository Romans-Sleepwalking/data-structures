Ask user to  input a character or digit.

Output a corresponding word from the NATO alphabet:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO_phonetic_alphabet

So if user inputs A, your program should output Alpha

If user inputs B, your program should output Bravo and so on

...

If user inputs 1, your program should output One

rest of digits similarly

If user inputs 0, your program should output Zero

If user inputs something that is not uppercase letter or digit, you should output Not Recognized

PS There are multiple ways of solving this, you can use an approach not covered in class.
