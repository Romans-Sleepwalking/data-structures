Write a function isPrime which checks whether an integer is prime or not.

If a number is 1 or less it should return false.

Call isPrime from your main function on the following three numbers

1'000'001, 1'000'021, 1'000'037

Enter the three answers in Text submission field (for example true, false, true)

Submit your main.cpp just like previous assignments
