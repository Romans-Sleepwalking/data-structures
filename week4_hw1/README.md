Write a program that finds TWO missing numbers out of 50 numbers.

Numbers are unique, not in any order, and their values are from 1 to 50.

You have 48 numbers you do not know which 2 numbers are missing.



Submit your source code as file with your name and student id comments up top

//FirstName_LastName_220ADB5325

Your program should be able to read the text file provided missing_2_numbers.txt .
Then perform the calculations.

Comment your code! Uncommented code will get less or no score!

Also submit the solution - the two numbers as text  (for example 21, 46)
